**API for consulting sales prediction**

I have created an API to check the sales predictions according to the investment in advertising. It is based on a regression model that predicts the sales generated according to different advertising revenues.

Endpoints:

1. /prediction: sales prediction based on all advertising expenditure values
2. /ingest_data: store new records in the database
3. /retrain: retrain the model again with the new records and save the new model

In this project I've worked with:

Python 🐍 · Pandas 🐼 · Flask 🦏 · SQL 🔎 · Sklearn 🤖
